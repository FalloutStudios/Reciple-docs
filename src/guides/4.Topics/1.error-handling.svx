# Error Handling

Using our external package [`reciple-anticrash`](https://npmjs.org/package/reciple-anticrash) simplifies error handling. This prevents process and client errors from crashing your bot; instead, they log the stack trace and send the error to a Discord channel for convenient debugging.

### Two ways to install `reciple-anticrash`
- Select the addon `reciple-anticrash` when creating the bot project using `npm create reciple@latest`
- Install the package `reciple-anticrash` using `npm i reciple-anticrash`.
  - Then create a new module in your `./modules/addons` folder. In this case we will name it `reciple-anticrash.js`.
    ```js
    import { RecipleAnticrash } from 'reciple-anticrash';
    export default new RecipleAnticrash({
      reportChannels: process.env.ERROR_CHANNELS ? process.env.ERROR_CHANNELS.split(',') : []
    });
    ```

To add error channels, simply create a new entry in your `.env` file and add your channels separated by commas.
```properties
ERROR_CHANNELS="123456789012345678,987654321098765432"
```

Now, whenever there is an error, your bot will display these fancy error messages in its logs and error channels without crashing the entire bot process!
