# TypeScript
If you want type safety, you should probably consider TypeScript. Reciple supports TypeScript because it was written in TypeScript!

## Project Structure
You can create a TypeScript project automatically by choosing TypeScript as the programming language when setting up your bot using `npm create reciple@latest`. This process will generate a directory structure similar to that used in JavaScript.

```
mybot/
├── reciple.mjs
├── tsconfig.json
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── node_modules/
└── src/
```

When you used the JavaScript project, you'll notice that the `modules` folder is replaced with `src`, that's because TypeScript will automatically generate the JavaScript version of your modules into that directory during transpilation.

## Writting Modules

When writting modules, your modules directory by default is set to `src` and instead of `.js` we will use `.ts`.
```
mybot/
├── reciple.mjs
├── tsconfig.json
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── node_modules/
└── src/
    └── mymodule.ts
```

The way you code your modules may change, but not significantly. For example, here's how to write a Ping command in TypeScript.
```ts
import { AnyCommandResolvable, RecipleModuleData, SlashCommandBuilder } from 'reciple';

export class PingCommand implements RecipleModuleData {
    public commands: AnyCommandResolvable[] = [
        new SlashCommandBuilder()
            .setName('ping')
            .setDescription('Ping command')
            .setExecute(async ({ interaction }) => {
                await interaction.reply('Pong!');
            })
    ];

    public async onStart(): Promise<boolean> {
        return true;
    }
}

export default new PingCommand();
```

As you can see, it is best to explicitly type your properties and returns of a function.

## Precondition and Halts Folder

With typescript, you need to create the preconditions and halts folder in a subdirectory of your `src` directory. For example `src/preconditions` or `src/halts`.

To ignore your precondition and halts folder, just add the folder names in `modules.exclude` found in your `reciple.mjs`.

```js
export const config = {
    // ...other config...
    modules: {
        exclude: ['preconditions', 'halts']
    }
};
```
