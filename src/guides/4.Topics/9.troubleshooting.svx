# Troubleshooting

In this section, you will find some common issues and how to fix them. However, if you are still having problems, please do not hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/thenorthsolution/Reciple/issues/new/choose).

## Commands Are Not Registered

One of the common causes of why commands are not registered is if you have `reciple-registry-cache` installed and the commands are cached. If this is the case you will get a message like this:
```
[13:45:31 WARN] Application commands did not change! Skipping command register...
```

To solve this issue, clear the registry cache by deleting the `node_modules/.cache/reciple-registry-cache` directory. You will need to restart the bot for this to take effect and you'll get a message like this:

```
[13:45:31 WARN] Registed (3) application commands globally
```

*****

## Commands Are Not Loaded

Make sure your modules are properly exported and the commands are in the `commands` property of your module.

For example, if you have a module named `MyModule` that contains a slash command called `ping`, you will need to add this command to the `commands` property of your module.

```js
import { SlashCommandBuilder } from 'reciple';

export class MyModule {
    commands = [
        new SlashCommandBuilder()
            .setName('ping')
            .setDescription('Ping command')
            .setExecute(async ({ interaction }) => {
                await interaction.reply('Pong!');
            })
    ];

    onStart() {
        return true;
    }
}

// Export the instance of your module
export default new MyModule();
```

If the problem still persists, make sure the module is in a valid modules folder. You can see the list of valid modules in the [`reciple.mjs`](/guide/getting-started/configuration#modules) config.
